# Welcome to my **yearTwo** repo
### This is _some_ of my work from my second year of Computer Systems

* If you look at this and think that there's no way a second year with 0 prior experience could have written this your goddamn right
* Every 6 months I look back here and think to myself "Oh god look at how bad this code from 6 months ago is" and rewrite the whole thing.
* Same applies to general layout because Git is hard don't believe anyone who says otherwise.
