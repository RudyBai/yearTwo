# Welcome to my **yearTwo** repo
### This is _some_ of my work from my second year of Computer Systems

* If you look at this and think that there's no way a second year with 0 prior experience could have written this your goddamn right.
* Every 6 months I look back here and think to myself "Oh god look at how bad this code from 6 months ago is" and rewrite the whole thing.
* Same applies to general layout because Git is hard don't believe anyone who says otherwise.

Never going to be on this repo:
* Routing & Switching Concepts (COMP7032)
* Operating Systems (SOFT7006)
* Requirements Engineering (SOFT7007)
* Linux Administration (COMP7036)
* OO Analysis and Design (SOFT7005)
* Virtualisation Technologies (COMP7041)
* Probability & Statistics (STAT7007)

Coming Soonâ„¢ to a **yearTwo** repo near you!:
* C/Assignemnt Two

NoSQL Didn't work out too well so I'd be very careful taking any inspiration from there. :cowboy_hat_face:

```python
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
