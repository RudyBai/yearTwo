# Welcome to my **yearTwo** repo
### This is _some_ of my work from my second year of Computer Systems

* If you look at this and think that there's no way a second year with 0 prior experience could have written this your goddamn right.
* Every 6 months I look back here and think to myself "Oh god look at how bad this code from 6 months ago is" and rewrite the whole thing.
* Same applies to general layout because Git is hard don't believe anyone who says otherwise.

Never going to be on this repo:
* Routing & Switching Concepts (COMP7032)
* Operating Systems (SOFT7006)
* Requirements Engineering (SOFT7007)
* Linux Administration (COMP7036)

NoSQL Didn't work out too well so I'd be very careful taking any inspiration from there.
